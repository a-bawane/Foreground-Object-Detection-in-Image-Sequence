# Foreground-Object-Detection-in-Image-Sequence
Detection of Foreground Object using background Subtracton 
Image sequence (people running around in an airstrip) consisting of
RGB images and corresponding ground-truth images of foreground detection. 
following parameters for foreground extraction – v d = 9.0, m = 5, η v = 0.6 and t c = 0.01. 
Sensitivity (s) and False Alarm Rate (ρ) evaluated for λ = {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0}. 
the ROC Curve ploted using these (s, ρ) values.
